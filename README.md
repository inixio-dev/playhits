# Playhits

This project is developed by Inixio Amillano. It uses NestJS for the Backend and Angular for the Frontend. It integrates the official Spotify API and allows the user to add songs to the Spotify Queue of a pub.

The user scans the QR code available in the pub and will see all the songs available in the catalogue, whitelisted by the manager from the Playlists of the pub. A user can make a maximum number of 2 requests per hour.

This project was successfully launched in may 2022 and has been working successfully and appreciated by pub workers and customers ever since.

## To do

Recently, Spotify finally launched the official Node SDK and the Playhits backend should be updated replacing the HTTP requests by the official SDK for a better management of all the functionality related to Spotify.
